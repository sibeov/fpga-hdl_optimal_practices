# Introduction
Inspired by Jason Turners book [Cpp - Best Practices](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cppbestpractices) and the
fact that the initial author (@sibeov) miss something similar. This is an attempt to develop a forever changing,
open-source and free book discussing, evaluating and always having up-to-date best practices in accordance with the
FPGA-development industry. It is no attempt to rival similar books and is also something which started as a hobby and 
knowledge base for the initial author.

## HDLs
The book is HDL-agnostic, meaning that VHDL, (System)verilog etc shall be equally represented with source-code examples
and discussions. For the moment, only (System)verilog and VHDL will be represented in the book. But this (with
intention) and the rest of this project/book is prone to change.

## Rules / Specifications
1. Examples shall be represented in both (System)verilog and VHDL.
